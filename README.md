# Student-Alcohol-Consumption-Dashboard
The purpose behind this project was to highlight the data visualization skills. I love to play with data and explore the 
unexplored. There is so much information on student alcohol consumption that it became really challenging to showcase the important information. Thus,
I created an interactive dashboard where the user himself can control the amount of alcohol consumption to understand different aspects of a student's life.
For example, when the alcohol consumption filter is brought to '2-4' (low) more students do well in school overall as compared to '8-10' (high). The 
dashboard tries to bring out all the important factors affecting alcohol consumption in a student's life.
